# tabb

A restaurant management system that separates how orders are placed from how they are viewed - built on the CQRS pattern.

## Architecture

This project follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** with **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**.

```
src/tabb/
├── domain/          # Core business logic — pure Python, no dependencies
│   └── shared/      # Shared kernel (base entity, etc.)
├── application/     # Use cases, ports (interfaces), DTOs
└── adapters/        # Inbound (API) and outbound (persistence) adapters
    └── config/      # Application settings (pydantic-settings)
```

### Dependency Rule

Dependencies point **inward** only:
- `domain/` depends on nothing
- `application/` depends on `domain/`
- `adapters/` depends on `application/` and `domain/`
